Although South Africa’s first decimal coin series was released in 1961, no R5 coins were minted until 1994. In that year, two R5 coins were issued: the reverse of the first commemorated the Presidential Inauguration and that of the second depicted the Gnu (Black Wildebeest). Since 1996, South Africa’s 11 official languages have been acknowledged annually, in rotation, through the representation of the word. Two Rand (R2) As part of the third decimal series, it was agreed that the Kudu be portrayed on South Africa’s first R2 circulation coin. Initially, a leopard design was considered for the R2 but it was decided that designs for the R1, R2 and R5 should be the antelope. The Kudu is known as the “King of the Antelope” because of its magnificent horns. One Rand (R1) The first Springbok appeared as long ago as 1947 as a truly South African symbol on our silver crown size coins. The original design is still viewed as one of the best designs in the world. Based on the original artwork of one of South Africa’s famous sculptors, Coert Steynberg, the Springbok was used on various other South African coins. The words “SOLI DEO GLORIA” (“To God alone the Glory”) appear on the R1 coins. Sources www.samint.co.za Image: South African Mint Instagram
