Almost a year into the country battling Coronavirus, President Ramaphosa is set to deliver the State of the Nation Address(SONA), South Africa’s most important event in the annual calendar on Thursday, February 11 at 19:00, under the theme “Following up on our commitments: making your future work better”. SONA is called by the President in terms of Section 42(5) of the Constitution. It is a joint sitting of the two Houses of Parliament and one of the rare occasions that bring together the three arms of the State namely; the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature under one roof. The President uses this opportunity to speak to the nation on the general state of South Africa, reflecting on a wide range of political, economic and social matters within the domestic and global contexts. He also accounts to the nation on progress made by the government and to set out the s programme of action for the coming year. Traditionally, the President makes key Government announcements during this joint sitting of Parliament. SONA 2021, in the year of the pandemic will adhere to the National State of Disaster regulations, in the form of a hybrid joint sitting, with at least no more than 50 Members of Parliament. Due to the limited number of persons permitted within the precincts of Parliament, and Parliament’s sensitivity to the prevailing conditions, various ceremonial aspects that usually characterise the SONA have been suspended. Therefore, a huge saving on the SONA budget which will help rejuvenate the economy.
