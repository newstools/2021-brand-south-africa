The festival is aligned to Brand South Africa‚Äôs strategic objective of promoting South Africa‚Äôs image internationally and reach a wide range of Global South Africans. The first virtual festival was hosted in March with the annual Festival set to take place on the 24th of July in Willen Lake Milton Keynes (UK). Opening remarks at the festival were delivered by the Acting CEO of Brand South Africa Ms Thulisile Manzini; ‚ÄúWe are meeting during trying times where we each know somebody who has been affected or infected by COVID-19. What 2020 has taught us is that life is precious, and that we should value our lives and those around us. The pain and the suffering we have felt as individuals and as a collective made it imperative for Brand South Africa to ensure we find ways to uplift your spirits through this festival and celebrate our humanness.‚Äù Ms Manzini further emphasized the value of Global South Africans saying; ‚Äúyou will very often be the first point of contact and reference for people overseas, whose judgements and decisions have a profound impact on the fortunes of our country. You as Global South Africans have the responsibility to show the world what South Africans are made of, why we are worth investing in.‚Äù In case you missed the Mzansi Festival click here to watch.
