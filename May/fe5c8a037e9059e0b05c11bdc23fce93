COVID-19 vaccines have been produced worldwide to be used as protection against the disease and develop an immune response to the virus. Developing immunity through vaccination means there is a reduced risk of developing the illness and its consequences. This immunity helps you fight the virus if exposed. Getting vaccinated therefore means you are part of the solution in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in the country. According to Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, the Electronic Vaccination Data System (EVDS) is now available and marks a significant milestone not only for the national vaccination campaign but for South Africa’s advancement towards Universal Health Coverage. South Africans are encouraged to now register to be vaccinated. Phase two of the country’s vaccine rollout will begin on 17th May 2021 with millions of vaccine doses expected to arrive in South Africa in the coming weeks. The aim is to finalise phase two within six months, by the end of October 2021. Government has called on all citizens aged 60 years and above to register for vaccination. The importance of registering means that you will be able to stay informed about being vaccinated and the vaccination. Brand South Africa urges those with resources in their communities to play their part and help citizens aged 60 years and above to register for the vaccine. The fight against COVID-19 can be won through unity in action and taking care of each other. HOW TO REGISTER The information provided when you register will be used to communicate with you about the vaccination programme when necessary. Minister Dr Mkhize said the department will send out teams to help vulnerable citizens who do not have access to digital technology. The importance of registering makes impactful strides to ensuring that the country is able to fight COVID-19 and work towards flattening the curve.
